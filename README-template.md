To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS flexbox tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background) - This helped me learn about flexbox and how to style components in a grid layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Customize range slider](https://brennaobrien.com/blog/2014/05/style-input-type-range-in-every-browser.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me style my range slider for different themes.
